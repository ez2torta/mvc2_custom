Howdy!

There are two versions of 1st_read.bin in this package that have been created by Jed.  You can only use ONE of them.  Your two options are:

** 1st_read_2020-02-FullUnlockWithoutVMU

This is the older package.  These changes:
	* Fully unlock characters for your Dreamcast MvC2 without using a VMU.  Don't use a VMU: you don't need it.
	* Fix stage randomization.  Random stage select in vanilla MvC2 doesn't actually use all possible stages: with this update it will now.

** 1st_read-2021-10-AllowNewSongs

This is the new package.  This includes:
	* Fully unlock characters for your Dreamcast MvC2 without using a VMU.  Don't use a VMU: you don't need it.
	* Fix stage randomization.  Random stage select in vanilla MvC2 doesn't actually use all possible stages: with this update it will now.
	* You can now customize the music for "alternate" versions of stages, such as the different versions of Ship, Desert, and so forth.

The full ADX file list with this version is now:
	Air_Ship            ADX_S000
	Desert              ADX_S010
	Factory             ADX_S020

	Cave                ADX_S050
	Clock               ADX_S060

	Challenger          ADX_HERE
	Game Over           ADX_OVER
	Ranking             ADX_RANK
	Win Screen          ADX_WINS
	Main Menu           ADX_MENU
	Network Menu        ADX_NETW
	Alternate Ship      ADX_NSHP
	Alternate Desert    ADX_NDST
	Alternate Carnival  ADX_NCRN
	Alternate Swamp     ADX_NSWP
	Alternate Cave      ADX_NCAV
	Alternate Clock     ADX_NCLK
	Alternate River     ADX_NRFT

All the "new" options are labeled as "Alternate".  Note if you do not include the new "alternate" songs then no music will play for that stage.  For your convenience, you can just copy the existing "alternate" tracks onto your mix.

Thanks for playing Marvel vs Capcom 2!
