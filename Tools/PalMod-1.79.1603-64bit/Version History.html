<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.56</u></b>
<br><b>Important Change</b>: PalMod now builds Unicode instead of MBCS (functionally ANSI) as it used to.  This is not something you should notice, but it was a huge change internally.  If you see anything weird, please let me know immediately.
<br>Garou: Mark of the Wolves (Steam) support added.
<br>General: Salvage and warn for user-defined Extras that are out of bounds.  More actionable warning for people that forget to extract img2020.dat.  Revised the About dialog.
<br>Jojos: new palettes, new sprites.  We now warn you if you try to load a Venture ROM using Jojos support.
<br>MVC2-Dreamcast: Team View (at the end of the character list).

<br>Added new "Unknown NEO*GEO" option when loading ROMs: You can use this with an Extras file to explore ROMs PalMod doesn't know about.
<br>Jojos, Garou: new palettes added.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.52</u></b>
<br>General: Add support for NEO*GEO colors (RGB666). Which leads to...
<br>Garou: Mark of the Wolves support added.
<br>General: Game information is now loaded only when you load that game.  That means you can make live updates to your Extras file and then just use Load Last File to reload the game and your Extras file.  PalMod startup is now faster and it uses 2MB less memory on startup.
<br>General: Various fine tuning of Extras file support and de-dupe logic/messaging to make things easier with those.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.51</u></b>
<br>Jojos: dynamically reload/update the Extras file when reloading the game, new sprites, new palettes
<br>MVC2-Arcade: re-sort the UI, add a new Team View option at the bottom of the "character" list
<br>Improved ACT support: handle miswritten "colorless" ACTs, better handling of 256 color palettes in 8 color per line / 128 color per page mode (but you really want to use 16 color per line mode if you're using 256 color palettes.)

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.50</u></b> <i>version jump due to significant internal changes</i>
<br>
<li>MvC2-Naomi: Use the supplemental processing logic.  This means you don't have to edit related Extras sprites yourself for the main character sprite.
<li>MvC2-Dreamcast: Fixes a bunch of issues in the supplemental processing logic affecting Spider-Man, Jin, Megaman, Roll, Iceman, and Silver Samurai.
<li>Jojos: Desert Noon stage sprites.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.43</u></b>
<br>
<li>MvC2: Naomi support.
<li>Jojos: Many new sprites.
<li>MSH: Character select portraits.
<li>SFA3: Stage palettes.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.42</u></b>
<br>
<li>General: Add 16 color per line view.  This should be useful for editing stages.
<li>General: Allow up to 256 color palettes.  You can view those fully in 16 color per line mode: in normal 8 color per line mode we'll show them across two pages.  Currently only used for MSH portraits.
<li>General: Fix support for Photoshop ACT "772 byte" file write/reads.
<li>General: improve internal handling of Extras.  We now support up to 10,000 extras per file.  That's mostly ridiculous unless you're spelunking a ROM, but hey you can do it.
<li>Jojo's: New preview sprites from string! Adds Khan, Avdol, and Petshop.
<li>MvC2: Use Eidrian's Palette Guide description strings for all moves.  Should make things easier.
<li>COTA: Expose the palettes for character select icons, portraits, and Colossus shine/super portraits.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.41</u></b>
<br>
<li>Add COTA support.  Should be complete: feedback is welcomed as always.
<li>More sprites for Jojos/MSHvSF.
<li>XMvSF: status effect palettes.
<li>MSHvSF: Shuma P2 and some other palettes.
<li>Jojos: improved palette ranges.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.40</u></b>
<br>
<li>General: Larger palette display for portraits and such.
<li>MvC: Close to complete sprite and portrait coverage.
<li>General: Improved Extras support and multisprite Export Image.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.39</u></b>
<br>
<li>Vs Series: a lot of new sprites and portraits.
<li>General: Fixed display on high DPI systems.
<li>Jojo's: Starting to add sprites.  Just need more RAW texture files and we can plug those in.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.38</u></b>
<br>
<li>Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter: Add support.
<li>Enable multisprite export for all the games.
<li>Various new sprites.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.37</u></b>
<br>
<li>SFA3: add sprites for all characters
<li>ST/SFA3: Move to new code layout style.  Also fixed a Blanka Color 9 palette glitch since it has a quirk in the ROM.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.36</u></b>
<br>
<li>Added Marvel Super Heroes support.
<li>MVC 1: add sprites for the Character Select / Duo portraits
<li>General: fix various old bugs.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.35</u></b>
<br>
<li>MvC 1: new palettes: Character Select, Super, Victory Screen, and Character Select Icons.
<li>General: fix various old bugs.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.34</u></b>
<br>
<li>General: You can now load external sprites for previews in PalMod.  Use File :: Load Texture in the Preview window.  We only support RAW texture files and need the width and height in the filename, as in "ryu-W-111-H-115.data" or "alex-W-111-H-115.raw".  Yes RAW files are weird.  This support is brand new and will be refined further as we go along.


<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.33</u></b>
<br>
<li>Jojos: Lots of updates to the Jojos layout per feedback from the community.  Also adds support for a lot more of the Jojos palettes.  The "letter" updates (133a, 133b, etc) are all just new Jojos hexes.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.32</u></b>

<li>Jojos: Integrate Jojos editing.  Make sure to use the new Jojos mode when you choose Load File.  If you need further Extras past this the filenames are jojos50e.txt and jojos51e.txt respectively.  Please note that you probably don't need to use a Jojos extra file: everything should be in PalMod now. Any ROM areas duplicated between PalMod and your Extras file will <b>not</b> patch properly: any Jojos extra file nowadays should be very small.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.31</u></b>

<li>MvC2: Fix SonSon's supplemental palette handling.  Fix a case where "check my edit" would incorrectly say that the mix couldn't be fixed.


<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.30</u></b>

<li>MvC2: New autopatching!  The new "Check My Edits" button does a simple validation pass over your palettes, ensuring that if you had changed Cyclops, for example, that his associated HK palette was also changed.  This "Check My Edits" option is meant for previously created mixes and should help you fix those in seconds.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.29</u></b>

<li>MvC2 "Process Supplement Palettes": Fixed a longstanding integer overflow issue affecting Megaman, Spiral, and Shuma's Extra palettes.  Spiral was just for A2 colors, Megaman was for HK, A1, and A2, and Shuma was just broken.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.28</u></b>

<li>MvC2 "Process Supplement Palettes": Fixed Sent's Extra 01 copy, handle all Spiral's Dance frames, and fixed Wolvie/Bonevie's berserker barrage trail effect.  This is everything I'm aware of that needed fixing for supplement palettes: please hit me up if I missed anything.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.27</u></b>

<li>MvC2: Fix support for dual palette handling, as in Tron Bonne and CapCom's Extra 02 and 03.  This is the correct fix for the original "Hover" crash that plagued everybody in the 1.22 hack builds that went around.

<li>MvC2 "Process Supplement Palettes": When you update the LP palette for characters in Spiral's Metamorphosis Dance super, those are now also copied over to the appropriate Extra palettes for Spiral.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.26</u></b>

<li>MvC2 "Process Supplement Palettes": If this Easy Mode is on, we now automatically tint the extra sprites for Cyclops (0x5a for LP), Zangief (0x17-0x19 for LP), and Cammy (0x9-0x11 for LP).  The tint factors are tweakable, so let me know if it should be adjusted further.

<li>MvC2 "Process Supplement Palettes":  Handle MechaGief (0x11 to 0x29-2b for LP) and Lilith (Morrigan's Extra 1 to 0x4b-4c for LP).  Fixed Morrigan's taunt sprites, Spiderman's Spider Signal sprites, and Rogue's taunt / win pose.

<li>PhotoShop compat: Use 772b ACT files instead of 768b ACT files, as 772 works better with PhotoShop.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.25</u></b>

<li>ST: Used an img.dat with ST sprites.

<li>XMvSF/ST: Fixed a crash when trying to export sprites.

<li>XMvSF: Updated palette editing: friendly names and additional sprites are used where known or available.

<li>3S for DC: Fixed saving changes back to the palette files.

<p>
<b><u>PalMod v1.24</u></b>

<li>MvC1: We now show sprites we had from the MvC2 work where appropriate: most characters and effects have sprites now.

<li>MvC1: Add editing for Ken, Akuma, and MechaGief. Added Megaman's extra palettes.  So so many.

<li>MvC1: Add editing for every assist palette that I'm aware. Thanks to IceManual for helping gather those offsets.

<li>Fix editing X-Ism palettes for SFA3.

<li>MvC1: Add support for extensible extra palettes.  The stock mvce.txt included adds in support for a few of the assist characters.  That should help you get started.  I may flesh that out further as I have time.  The format should be fairly logical.  For characters with larger ranges you might want to do 0x00020 through 0x00060, perhaps, instead of just the 32 (0x20) palettes I demonstrate here.

<li>Various code cleanup and we remember window position.  Hopefully that's not annoying.

Hello again!  This is fundamentally a minor release, but is the first in a very long time. Expect regular small updates for a while on a close to daily basis.  Check back regularly for updates.

<li>MvC1: Fixed editing for Gambit, Morrigan, and Shadow Lady thanks to help from IceManual.
<li>String updates: make sure we display full version information everywhere.
<li>Get Roll's supplemental palettes as functional as Megaman's are.
<li>Fixed Gief's boots/clothes supplemental palette generation.  Gief's supplemental body frames (palettes 0x17-0x19 and 0x29-2B, indexes 1-7) are TINTs and have not been touched yet.
<li>Reverted to the Dec 2008 image.dat as that has better coverage of Extra sprites.

<li>Fixed Chun-Li's supplemental palette generation.
<li>Fixed alpha being reset when switching between 32bit/8bit display
